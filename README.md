# Getting to know Drupal 8 
## Accessibility Tools & Techniques
   
This is a custom theme based off of [Bootstrap theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap),
used to illustrate the examples contained withing the "Getting to know Drupal 8:
Accessibility Tools & Techniques" presentation given at AccessibilityCamp Toronto 2016.

## Installation
This theme depends on the [Bootstrap theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap).

Install and enable this theme in any D8 site through your normal usage. 

I recommend using [Drupal Composer](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).
